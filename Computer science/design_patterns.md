**Design patterns:** general repeatable solution to common occuring problems


**Creational design patterns**
1. Factory Method - Define an interface to create an object 
2. Abstract Factory - Factory of factories
3. Builder - 
4. Object Pool - 
5. Prototype - Just clone or provide copy of object
6. Singleton - Ensure the class has only one instance(using static variable,method,if decision)

**Structural design patterns**
1. Adapter - 
2. Bridge - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
3. Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
4. Decorator - Add responsibilities using inheritance(but inherit only data not behaviour)
5. Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
6. Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
7. Private Class Data - Restricts accessor/mutator access
8. Proxy - An object representing another object

**Behavioral design patterns**-  Class's objects communication
1. Chain of responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
2. Command - Encapsulate the request(task or command) 
3. Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
4. Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
5. Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
6. Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
7. Null Object - Designed to act as a default value of an object
8. Observer - One to many (list of objects in local variable, call update method in for loop list)
9. State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
10. Strategy - Switch algorithm (convert inheritance into interface)
11. Template method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
12. Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change
