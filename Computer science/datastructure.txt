DATA STRUTURE:
	1. Primitive datastructure
		int
		float
		char
		pointers
		
	2. Non-primitive datastructure
		Array
		List
			Linear list - stack, queue
			Non linear list - graph, tree
		Files


Abstract data types:
	it is a type or class for object, whose behaviour is defined bu implementations hide
	1.List ADT - elements of same type arranged in sequence order 
		get(), insert(), remove(), removeAt(), replace(),size(), isEmpty(), isFull()
	2.Stack ADT - FILO all operation take place at single end ie.top of stack 
		push(), pop(), peek(), size(), isEmpty(), isFull()
	3.Queue ADT - FIFO operation takes place in both ends, insertion at one end and deletion at another end
		enqueue(), dequeue(), peek(), size(), isEmpty(), isFull()
		->inserting values in queue is call enqueue
		->retrieving value is called dequeue
		->deletion is done from first in element
	
Tree- 	Hierarchical tree structure with set of linked nodes
	1.Binary tree - have only 2 nodes
	2.B-tree
	3.Multiway tree
