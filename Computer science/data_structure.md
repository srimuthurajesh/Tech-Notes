## DATA STRUTURE:
1. Primitive datastructure - int,float,char,pointers
2. Non-primitive datastructure - 
	1. Array
	2. List
		1. Linear list - stack, queue
		2. Non linear list - graph, tree


**Abstract data types:** it is a type or class for object, whose behaviour is defined by implementations hide
1. List ADT -  ``` get(), insert(), remove(), removeAt(), replace(),size(), isEmpty(), isFull() ```
2. Stack ADT - FILO all operation take place at single end ie.top of stack 
```
push(), pop(), peek(), size(), isEmpty(), isFull()
```
3. Queue ADT - FIFO operation takes place in both ends, insertion at one end and deletion at another end
```
enqueue(), dequeue(), peek(), size(), isEmpty(), isFull()
```
->inserting values in queue is call enqueue
->retrieving value is called dequeue
->deletion is done from first in element

Tree- 	Hierarchical tree structure with set of linked nodes
	1.Binary tree - have only 2 nodes
	2.B-tree
	3.Multiway tree
