## DATA STRUTURE:
1.Primitive datastructure - int,float,char,pointers  
2.Non-primitive datastructure - Array, List, stack, queue, graph, tree

## Array:
Collection of similar items in continuos memory location
## Linked list:
1. single 2.Double 3.Circular
## Stack:

## Queue:
FIFO operation takes place in both ends, insertion at one end and deletion at another end
	1. inserting values in queue is call enqueue
	2. retrieving value is called dequeue
	3. deletion is done from first in element

## Tree:
-non linear datastruture, undirected graph. Teminologies: root, node, leaf, level, width, depth, height, degree  

### Binary tree - have maximum 2 nodes  
Types of Binary trees:
1.Full/proper/strict Btree - should have two/zero children  
2.Complete Btree - last level as left as possible  
3.Perfect Btree all the leaf at same level  
4.Degenerate Btree - all nodes having only one child  
Typres of Representation : 
1.Sequential   
2.Array  
left child position - 2i+1
right child position - 2i+2
parent position - (i-1)/1
max number of nodes in height = (2^h+1)-1

	2.B-tree
	3.Multiway tree
## Heap:
## Hash:

## Graph:
collection of nodes(vertices) which connected between edges  
**complete graph:** all nodes conneced together(formula = n(n-1)/2)  
**Terminoloy**:
1. length = no of edges
2. cost =  sum of weight at each node
3. cyclic = path start and ends in same node
4. acyclic = contains no cycle
