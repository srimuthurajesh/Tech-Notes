## DATA STRUTURE:
1.Primitive datastructure - int,float,char,pointers  
2.Non-primitive datastructure - Array, List, stack, queue, graph, tree

## Array:
Collection of similar items in continuos memory location
## Linked list:
1. single 2.Double 3.Circular
## Stack:

## Queue:
FIFO operation takes place in both ends, insertion at one end and deletion at another end
	1. inserting values in queue is call enqueue
	2. retrieving value is called dequeue
	3. deletion is done from first in element

## Tree:
 Hierarchical tree structure with set of linked nodes
	1.Binary tree - have only 2 nodes
	2.B-tree
	3.Multiway tree
## Heap:
## Hash:

## Graph:
collection of nodes(vertices) which connected between edges  
**complete graph:** all nodes conneced together(formula = n(n-1)/2)  
**Terminoloy**:
1. length = no of edges
2. cost =  sum of weight at each node
3. cyclic = path start and ends in same node
4. acyclic = contains no cycle
