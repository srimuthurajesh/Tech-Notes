**Design patterns:** general repeatable solution to common occuring problems


**Creational design patterns**
1. Factory Method - Provide object of another class
2. Abstract Factory - Factory of factories
3. Builder - 
4. Object Pool - 
5. Prototype - Just clone or provide copy of object
6. Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist

**Structural design patterns**
1. Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes
2. Bridge - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
3. Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
4. Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
5. Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
6. Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
7. Private Class Data - Restricts accessor/mutator access
8. Proxy - An object representing another object

**Behavioral design patterns**-  Class's objects communication
1. Chain of responsibility -A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
2. Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
3. Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
4. Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
5. Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
6. Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
7. Null Object - Designed to act as a default value of an object
8. Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
9. State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
10. Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
11. Template method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
12. Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change
