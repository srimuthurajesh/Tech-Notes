**Design patterns:** general repeatable solution to common occuring problems


**Creational design patterns**
1. Factory Method - Provide object of another class
2. Abstract Factory - Factory of factories
3. Builder - 
4. Object Pool - 
5. Prototype - Just clone or provide copy of object
6. Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist

**Structural design patterns**
7. Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes
8. Bridge - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
9. Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
10. Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
11. Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
12. Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
13. Private Class Data - Restricts accessor/mutator access
14. Proxy - An object representing another object

**Behavioral design patterns**-  Class's objects communication
15. Chain of responsibility -A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
16. Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
17. Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
18. Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
19. Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
20. Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
21. Null Object - Designed to act as a default value of an object
22. Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
23. State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
24. Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
25. Template method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
26. Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change
