    17. 10Base-T  10 refer to data transfer rate 10mbps, base refer to baseband, T refer to twisted pair cable
    18. NOS Network operating system
    19. DoS denial of service attack is an attempt to prevent user from being able to acces internet
    20. why using shielded, twisted pair cables- to avoid crosstalk which is em interference or noice
    21. Address sharing- use to security benefit
    22. MAC media access control, physical address, 6 bytes
    23. Class A-begins with 0 B- begins with 10 C begins with 110
    24. OSPF open shortest path first
    25. Star topology- consists one central hub connect to all nodes, easiest topology

    28. netstat- command line utitlity program provides useful information about current tcp/ip
    29. ping- utility program that allow to chrck connectivity between network devices 
    30. Network admin- 1.installation 2. configuration 3.troubleshooting maintainence
    31. Hybrid network- use both client-server and peer-to-peer architecture
    32. DHCP- Dynamic host configuration protocol which automatically allocates ip address 
    33. ARP Address Resolution Protocol is to map ip address to a MAC address
    34. Peer 2 peer- all pc act as individual workstation
    35. Straight through- is connect computer to hub or router
    36. Cross over- used to connect two similar devices pc to pc
    37. Clustering support refer to ability of NOS to connect multiple servers in a fault tolerent group
    38. SMTP- simple mail transfer protocol deals with mai delivery services on TCP/IP
    39. RSA- Riverst shamir adelman algorithm, most commoly used public eky encryption
    40. RTT round trip time- duration of time takes to send a message from one end to another
    41. ICMP- internet control message protocol- messaging and communication for TCP/IP, also manage error messages
    42. Pipelining- a task is begin before previous task ends
    43. Simplex- unidirectional, one can transmit one can receive
    44. Half duplex-bidirectional but not same time
    45. Full deuplex- bidirectional occurs simultaneously
    46. Multiplexing- dividing signal into various links for transmission it is 3types 1.wave dision multiplexing(anolog)  2.fdm(anolog) 3.tdm(digital)
    47. Errors- single bit error and burst error
    48. Redundancy- is sending extra bit for error detection 3 types- parity check, cyclic redundancy check (CRC), checksum
    49. Parity check- it is added every data unit, simple parity check can detect all single bit errors, it can detect burst error if the number of bit is odd
    50. Hamming code- is an error correction method using redundant bits
    51. ARQ- automatic repeat request- send a frame wait for an acknowledgement before sending next frames
    52. CSMA- carrier sense multiple access/CA/CD
    53. Firewall- electronic downbridge that moniter incoming outgoing network traffic based on specific rules
    54. TELNET- is a client server application
    55. Baseband is entire bandwidth is consumed by single signal
    56. Broadbrand is multiple signal frequencies passed

    57. Topologies
    58. point to point- fast reliable but small
    59. Bus topology- main backbone cable, one act as server. low cost easy ot connect but hard to troble shoot not use for large nw
    60. Star topology- central hub connection, low starup cost, easy to add nodes but expensive more cables
    61. Ring topology- circular connection data transfer in one direction, easy to install, manage, handling traffic but if one fault everyother affects
    62. mesh topology- each connected to each other,
    63. Hybrid topology- is connection of two topologies

    64. OSI layers-
    65. application layer- browser software
    66. presentation layer- os
    67. session layer- user get only certain website page
    68. Transport layer- how much information is sent back and forth
    69. Network layer- where router operates, tcp/ip protocol, ip addresses
    70. datalink layer- where switches operates, MAC
    71. Physical layer- where cables, ethernet etc




    72. 80/20 rule in networking- 80% of traffic should be in local and 20% towards remote network
