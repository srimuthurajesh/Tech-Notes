## Environment and Release Management in Product Management

In **Product Management**, managing environments is crucial for the software development lifecycle. It involves transitioning code through various environments for development, testing, and deployment. This falls under the following topics:

### Release Management
- **LOCAL**: Developer's machine where code is written and initially tested.
- **DEV (Development)**: A shared environment for developers to integrate and test their code.
- **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**: Where end-users test the application for requirements validation.
- **STAGING**: A pre-production environment for final testing before deployment.
- **PRE-PROD (Pre-Production)**: Environment used for stakeholder validation before production.

### Quality Assurance (QA) & Testing
- **SYSTEM TEST**: To test the full system integration and ensure modules work together.
- **PERFORMANCE TEST**: Environment for load and stress testing to evaluate system performance.
- **SANDBOX**: A testing environment to experiment without affecting real data or systems.
- **BETA**: A near-production environment where select users test the product under real-world conditions.

### Product Operations & Resilience Testing
- **PRODUCTION**: The live environment where users interact with the product.
- **CHAOS (Chaos Engineering)**: Practice where controlled failures are introduced to test system resilience.
- **MULTI-TENANT**: Architecture where multiple customers use the same product instance with data isolation.

### Additional Environments
- **BUILD INTEGRATION**: Environment for testing code builds and integration after merging.
- **BACKUP**: To test backup and recovery strategies.
- **TRAINING**: A training environment for end-users to learn how to use the product.
