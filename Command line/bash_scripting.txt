a=10 not as a = 10	//space not allowed, will taken as seperate commands
a="rajesh rockz" not as a=rajesh rockz	//need double quotes

#! /bin/bash
echo "hello $LOGNAME"
echo "The host name is `hostname`"

		to read value, we need to put $a
Two Types: 1. System variable  2.User defined variable

Export variables: 
	export varname=value
	sh root/root/scriptpath.sh
Unchanged variable:

	readonly varname
Lenght of value: ${#varname}
User input:
	read -p "please enter name" varname
	read -sp "please enter password" varname	//s for silent

DATATYPE: declare -i varname
Arithmatic operators: +-*/% **-exponential
Let: allow simple arithmetic expression		let a=a+1
Expression: expr 1 + 1	//result 2  expr 2 \* 3  should have space, not as 1+1
Arithmatic expansion: $[a + b] or $((a ** b))
&&- both sides should execute 
|| second side never executed until it is true
 
if Condition:
if [ "$a" == "yes" ]
then	
	command or code
else

fi

if else if condition:
if [condition]
then	
	command or code
elif[condition]
then
