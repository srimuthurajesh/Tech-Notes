methods would you apply for decreasing the loading time of a website?
I would use external style sheets, 
less images (unless necessary), 
optimize the images and decrease the file sizes of the image without reducing the quality of the image, 
use CSS sprites to reduce HTTP requests etc.

Search engines find it harder to parse the contents presented using Flash. I would suggest the client to use an alternative to flash like HTML 5.

keyword stemming:  The process of finding out the root word from the search query is referred as keywords stemming.
keyword density   ( Total number of keyword/ total number of words in your article) multiply by 100.
