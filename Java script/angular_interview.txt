	@input - passing data from parent to child component
	@output - passing event from child to parent component
8.What is data binding?
	property binding
	event binding
	two way binding			
9.Sequence of angular lifecycle
	OnChange()
	OnInint()
	Docheck()
	AfterContentInit()
	AferContentChecked()
	AfterViewInit()
	AfterViewChecked()
	OnDestroy()
10.What is Subscribe method?
	Whenever subscribe method is called, observable happens	
11.What is AsyncPipe?
	When observable or promise return something, we need temporary property to hold the content and then bind to template, but with Ayncpipe we can directly used it in template
12.Explain Authentication

	Js is not fully oops, supports all browser		
16.What is AOT?
	Angular Ahead-of-time compiler.		


Angular - Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript.
Module â€“ This is used to break the application into the logical pieces of the program code
Decorators - used as an identifier of class or type of the object that is created by the TypeScript

Data binding - 1.event binding 2. property binding
Router - The router interprets a link URL and navigat among diff application components and modules
ngOnChanges: When the value of a data bound property changes, then this method is called.
ngOnInit: initialization of the directive/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties happens.
ngDoCheck: This is for the detection and to act on changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.
ngOnDestroy: happens just before Angular destroys the directive/component. 

Component-specific hooks:
	ngAfterContentInit: This is called in response after Angular projects external content into the component's view.
	ngAfterContentChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the content projected into the component.
	ngAfterViewInit: This is called in response after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
	ngAfterViewChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the component's views and child views.

Event emitter: any change occurred in the component always gets propagated to all its children in hierarchy. If needs to be reflected to  parent component, we can emit the event.

The Angular Ahead-of-Time (AOT):  compiler converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code

Just-in-Time (JIT), which compiles your app in the browser at runtime.
Ahead-of-Time (AOT), which compiles your app at build time.
