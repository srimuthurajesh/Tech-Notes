Angular - Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript.
Module â€“ This is used to break the application into the logical pieces of the program code
Decorators - used as an identifier of class or type of the object that is created by the TypeScript

Data binding - 1.event binding 2. property binding
Router - The router interprets a link URL and navigat among diff application components and modules
ngOnChanges: When the value of a data bound property changes, then this method is called.
ngOnInit: initialization of the directive/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties happens.
ngDoCheck: This is for the detection and to act on changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.
ngOnDestroy: happens just before Angular destroys the directive/component. 

Component-specific hooks:
	ngAfterContentInit: This is called in response after Angular projects external content into the component's view.
	ngAfterContentChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the content projected into the component.
	ngAfterViewInit: This is called in response after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
	ngAfterViewChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the component's views and child views.

Event emitter: any change occurred in the component always gets propagated to all its children in hierarchy. If needs to be reflected to  parent component, we can emit the event.
