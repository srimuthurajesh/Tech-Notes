# Kanban
## Overview:
> Kanban is a visual workflow management method used to manage and improve work across various stages.

> It focuses on continuous delivery and flow by visualizing work and limiting work in progress (WIP).

## Key Components:

### Kanban Board:
1. Columns: Represent different stages of the workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Tasks move from left to right as they progress through stages.
2. Cards: Represent individual tasks or work items. Each card typically contains details about the task, such as description, due date, and assignees.
3. Work In Progress (WIP) Limits:  
Set limits on the number of tasks allowed in each stage to prevent overloading and ensure focus on completing tasks before starting new ones. Helps in identifying bottlenecks in the workflow.

4. Workflow Visualization:  
The Kanban board provides a visual representation of the work process, allowing teams to see the status of tasks at a glance and identify areas needing attention.

### Continuous Delivery:
Kanban focuses on maintaining a steady flow of work. Tasks are pulled into the workflow as capacity allows, rather than being planned in fixed iterations. This allows for more flexibility in responding to changing priorities and requirements.

4. Benefits:

- Visualizes work and workflow, making it easier to manage and track progress.
- Improves efficiency and productivity by focusing on completing tasks and reducing work in progress.
- Facilitates continuous improvement by identifying and addressing bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- Provides flexibility to adjust priorities and workload without the constraints of time-boxed iterations.

### Summary:
Scrum: Structured framework with defined roles, fixed-length sprints, and regular ceremonies. Emphasizes iterative development, team collaboration, and incremental delivery.
Kanban: Flexible visual management method focusing on continuous flow and improvement. Uses a Kanban board to visualize work and manage workflow with WIP limits.
