# Scrum
### Overview:
> Scrum is an Agile framework designed for managing and completing complex projects. 

It focuses on iterative progress through fixed-length sprints and emphasizes collaboration, accountability, and continuous improvement.

### Key Components:
#### Roles:
1. Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and helps the team adhere to Scrum practices.
2. Product Owner: Represents stakeholders, defines product features, and prioritizes the Product Backlog.
3. Development Team: Cross-functional group responsible for delivering the product increment. The team self-organizes and collaborates to complete the work.

#### Artifacts:
1. Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes required for the project. Maintained by the Product Owner.
2. Sprint Backlog: A subset of the Product Backlog selected for the current sprint, along with a plan to deliver the sprint goal.
3. Increment: The sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a sprint, which must be in a usable condition.

#### Events:
1. Sprint Planning: A meeting where the team plans the work to be done in the upcoming sprint. They select items from the Product Backlog and create a Sprint Backlog.
2. Daily Scrum (Stand-up): A brief daily meeting (usually 15 minutes) where team members discuss what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any impediments.
3. Sprint Review: A meeting at the end of the sprint where the team demonstrates what has been built and discusses feedback from stakeholders.
4. Sprint Retrospective: A meeting held after the Sprint Review to reflect on the sprint, discuss what went well, what didnâ€™t, and how to improve in the next sprint.

#### Sprints:
- Sprints are time-boxed iterations, typically 2-4 weeks long.  
- Each sprint starts with Sprint Planning and ends with a Sprint Review and Retrospective. 
- The goal is to produce a potentially shippable product increment by the end of each sprint.

### Benefits:
- Provides regular, predictable delivery of features.
- Encourages team collaboration and engagement.
- Allows for flexibility and adaptation based on feedback and changing requirements.
- Emphasizes continuous improvement through regular retrospectives.
