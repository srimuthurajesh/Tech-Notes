## Array
### 1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.  
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]  
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

### 2. [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)  
You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on an ith day.  
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.  
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.  
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]  
Output: 5  
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6),  
profit = 6-1 = 5.

### 3. [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[I].  
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.  
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.  
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [24,12,8,6]  

---

### 4. [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[I].  
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.  
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.  
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [24,12,8,6]  

---

### 5. [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.  
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]  
Output: 6  
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.  
Input: nums = [1]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum of 1.  

---

### 6. [Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)
Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.  
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]  
Output: 6  
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.  
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]  
Output: 0  
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray

--- 

### 7. [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.  
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.  
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.  

---

### 8. [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of the target if it is in nums,  
or -1 if it is not in nums.  
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.  

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0  
Output: 4  
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3   
Output: -1  

---

### 9. [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)  
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i],nums[j], nums[k]]  
such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.  
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.  

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]  
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]  
Explanation:  
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.  
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.  
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.  
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].  

---

### 10. [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)  
You are given an integer array height of length n.  
There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[I]).  

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.  
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.  

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]  
Output: 49  
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by an array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].  
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
