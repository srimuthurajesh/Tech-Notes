## Array
### 1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.  
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]  
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].  

2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a
given stock on an ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy
one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that
stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6),
profit = 6-1 = 5.

answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums
except nums[I].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without
using the division operation.
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
3. Contains Duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at
least twice in the array, and return false if every element is

Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a
subarray.
5. Maximum Subarray
Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest
sum, and return its sum.
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum of 1.

7. Find the Minimum in Rotated
Sorted Array
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return
the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n
vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are
(i, 0) and (i, height[I]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such
that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by an array
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section)
the container can contain is 49.
9. 3Sum
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i],
nums[j], nums[k]]
such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].

Given the head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list
has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that
can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that the
tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a
parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return
false.
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1

Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list,
where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of
adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A
node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the
path does not need to pass through the root.

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object

buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be
reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There
is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization
algorithm should work.
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a
string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree

13. Design Add and Search Words
Data Structure
WordDictionary() Initializes the object.
void addWord(word) Adds a word to the data structure, it can
be matched later.
bool search(word) Returns true if there is any string in the data
structure that matches the word or false otherwise. A word may
contain dots '.' where dots can be matched with any letter.
Design a data structure that supports adding new words and
finding if a string matches any previously added string.
Implement the WordDictionary class:
Input:["WordDictionary"
,
"addWord"
,
"addWord"
,
"addWord"
,
"search"
,
"search"
,
"search"

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most
frequent elements.
You may return the answer in any order.

3. Find Median from Data Stream
For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data
stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far.
Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size
of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the
mean of the two middle values.
Implement the MedianFinder class:
Input: ["MedianFinder"
,
"addNum"
,
"addNum"
,
"findMedian"
,
"addNum"
,
"findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output: [null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]
Explanation:
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1); // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2); // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3); // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node])
of its neighbors.
class Node {
public int val;
public List<Node> neighbors;
}
Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-
indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node
with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case
using an adjacency list.
An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to
represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of
a node in the graph.
The given node will always be the first node with val = 1.
You must return the copy of the given
node as a reference to the cloned graph.
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific
Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the
island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the
island's right and bottom edges.
The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given
an m x n integer matrix height where heights[r][c] represent the
height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).
The island receives a lot of rain, and the rainwater can flow to
neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the
neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's
height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the
ocean.
Return a 2D list of grid coordinates results where result[i] = [ri, ci]
denotes that rainwater can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific
and Atlantic oceans.

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original
string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing
the relative order of the remaining characters.
For example,
"ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is
common to both strings.

Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length
is 3.

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned
integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as
a signed integer type. They should not affect your
implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation
is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's
complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input
represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the
signed integer -1073741825.
