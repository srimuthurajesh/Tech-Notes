#PostgreSQL

> PostgreSQL has gained popularity over MySQL for modern applications due to its flexibility, advanced features, and improved performance. 

Here’s why:  

### Advanced SQL Features: 
PostgreSQL supports complex SQL functions like CTEs (Common Table Expressions), window functions, and advanced JSON handling (JSONB), making it highly versatile for structured and semi-structured data.

### Hybrid SQL/NoSQL Capabilities: 
With JSONB, PostgreSQL allows storage and querying of JSON data, supporting both structured and unstructured data. This hybrid approach suits applications needing both relational and document data.

### Improved Performance and Scaling: 
PostgreSQL offers parallel processing, partitioning, and horizontal scaling options, making it more suitable for handling high-traffic, data-intensive applications.

### Rich Open-Source Ecosystem: 
PostgreSQL has a strong community with many extensions (like PostGIS for geospatial data). AWS and cloud providers offer managed PostgreSQL services, simplifying scaling and management.

### Permissive Licensing: 
PostgreSQL’s open-source license is simple and flexible, whereas MySQL’s licensing has some restrictions due to  Oracle’s ownership.
